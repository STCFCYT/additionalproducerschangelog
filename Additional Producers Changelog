v2.0.1: Again, More Keep Coming

-Re-added the 2nd feature from Oct. 5, 2025, the Booster and Tickspeed Boosters only show up when (log(AP) > boostmult > 25) and (log(AP)/50 > tickspeedboostmult > 1.1), and edited the thumbnail

v1.3.0: New Notation

-Added a NEW Logarithmic Notation (5000 => e3.69, 80000 => e4.9) and fixed the tickspeed booster reward (because I could only figure out the code with addition to a base upgrade boost.) (July 2025, date forgotten, sorry I haven't listed dates because I was too lazy)
